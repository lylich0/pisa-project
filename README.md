# Supervised learning 
For this project, I used [PISA 2022 Database](https://www.oecd.org/en/data/datasets/pisa-2022-database.html),
specifically the [student questionnaire](https://www.oecd.org/en/data/datasets/pisa-2022-database.html#questionnaires)

- ST300Q02JA - How often do your parents or someone in your family Eat <the main meal> with you.
- ST354Q01JA - I felt lonely when school building was closed because of COVID-19?
- ST352Q08JA - Problems with finding someone who could help me with my school work.
- ST352Q06JA - Problems with motivating myself to do school work.
